# Contributing

Want to help out? We'd love it! Github will be the hub of development 
for all Apptimize projects. If you have any issues, comments, or 
complaints post them there. Additionally, we are definitely accepting
pull requests (hint: we almost always love more tests and
documentation). We do have just a few requests:

* Every method, function, and class should have include thorough in code documentation (e.g. javadoc or docstrings)
* There should be at least one unit test for each function and method
* In the case of bug fixes, we recommend a TDD approach, write a test that proves the bug and then write your code to fix it
* Keep your pull requests to one issue. (Preferably open an issue on github first for record keeping)
